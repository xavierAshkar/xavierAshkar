# 👋 Xavier Ashkar

🎓 **Undergraduate Student at Oregon State University**  
🧠 Passionate about building intuitive tools for **financial literacy**, **productivity**, and **personal growth**.

I enjoy crafting clean, beginner-friendly software that helps people feel more in control — whether that’s their finances, goals, or daily routines. I focus on creating thoughtful, modular applications with clear UI and strong backend structure.

## 🔨 Featured Project

### [Findash](https://github.com/xavierAshkar/findash-mvp)  
**A secure financial dashboard for beginners, built with Django**

Findash is a personal finance tool designed to help users:
- 🏦 Link their bank accounts (Plaid API integration)
- 📄 View transactions and filter by category
- 📊 Track budgets and visualize monthly spending
- 📈 Monitor growth and progress over time

It’s my current summer MVP project, and a launch point for improving my full-stack and product design skills.  
I’m treating it like a professional codebase, using GitHub Projects for issue tracking, clear commits, and milestone-based planning.
